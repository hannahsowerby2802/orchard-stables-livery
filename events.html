  <p><b><i>All Day Clinic with Jo Midgley</i></b>
  <br><br><br>
  Joe Midgley is a british horseman devoted to teaching both human and horse to
  develop a partnership that will allow them to achieve their greatest aspirations.
  <br><br>
  He trains through a physical and psychological understanding, meaning that he
  believes the emotions, or mental welfare of the horse is vital in creating that
  partnership and trust.
  <br><br>
  Joe has been recognised as one of the UK's leading  horsemen, specifically in
  the fields of educating and starting young horses and helping the troubled horse.
  <br><br>
  In his one day clinic, Joe will give demonstrations to the group, as well as
  moving around each horse and rider individually.
  <br><br>
  The clinic will start in the morning with a two hour long session, then there
  will be a lunch break in which Joe will be open to questions. The afternoon
  session will be a continuation and progression of the morning session.
  <br><br>

  Trec trainer Evie Priestley-O'Keefe will be back to give you instruction on

  <br><br>
  Evie is a TREC trainer based in West Yorkshire who runs clinics in all aspects
  of the sport of TREC, for all horses and riders - everyone is welcome!
  <br><br>
  Age, experience and confidence are never a barrier to joining in. Obstacle
  sessions are great cross-training and life experience for any horse, and very
  useful for improving the partnership between horse and rider.
  <br><br>
  The first hour of this session will be spent in the field on mobile obstacles
  then you will be taken down to CHAPs (Collingham Horse Adventure Park) for
  another hour of tuition. Afterward, you are welcome to stay and have a play
  before the next group comes down for their session.

  develop better skills.
